# ACID OCEAN DESIGN NOTES

## TODO

- the playback timing is out of sync
    - the issue is with startTime
- play/ pause

- fix zoom
- Add multiple tracks
- URL & LocalStorage 

- need a central area for all body click, event listener stufffff
    - fix isPaint

- try different scale (at least be either 2 gs or 2 cs)

- portemento swish
- accent border
- accent notes should have the colour of that bar
- hover btn should show what thing does...

- add extended note portemento

- if note select and is portemento, turn into that note (does so with accent & active so kinda inconsisitant)

- What happens to terminating portementos? and when a portemento normal note follows an accent?
    - the extended note goes from 
- What happens to an extended note, which last note is portemento, and the note after that is a different note?
- change icon colours to white to contrast accent colour
